# End-to-End Fake News Detection with Python

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to build an end-to-end fake news detection system using Python. The application leverages machine learning to classify news headlines as either "fake" or "real" and uses the Streamlit library to create a simple web interface for real-time predictions.

## Features

- **Machine Learning**: Uses the Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm to classify news headlines.
- **Real-Time Detection**: The application allows users to input news headlines and instantly receive predictions.
- **Web Interface**: Built with Streamlit, the web interface is user-friendly and easy to deploy.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Pip (Python package installer)

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Notchayan/EndtoEndFakeNewsDetection/
   cd EndtoEndFakeNewsDetection
Install the required libraries:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Alternatively, you can install the libraries individually:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn streamlit
Download the dataset:

Place the fake_or_real_news.csv dataset in the data/ directory. You can use any dataset with a similar structure (columns title and label).

Running the Application
To run the application, use the following command:

bash
Copy code
streamlit run filename.py
This will open the application in your default web browser.

Usage
Input: Enter a news headline in the provided text area.
Output: The application will display whether the entered headline is "fake" or "real."

Summary
This project provides a basic example of how machine learning models can be deployed in real-time applications using Python and Streamlit. It's a great starting point for anyone interested in building their own fake news detection systems or learning more about deploying machine learning models.
